## About Me

I am currently attending the University of Hawaii at Manoa & and studying Computer Engineering.

I plan on graduating in Fall 2024.

I chose to study Computer Engineering because I have been surrounded by computers all my life and want a better understanding of how they function.

After graduating I plan on taking any career in the field that offers good benefits.
